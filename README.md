## What is The Family Cookbook?
It is a platform for users to save their favorite recipes. My specific goal on the team was as the React I developer. I built all individual components for the project and worked under a React II developer to assist in anything she needed in regard to Redux and Axios with Auth requests.

### Tech/Languages Used:
React | Material UI | JavaScript | ReactHooks for validation | Redux| Axios

### Team Members
This was a build-week project that I worked on with fellow Lambda School Students over the course of a week. It was an absolute pleasure working with this team.
