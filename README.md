    Key:
        [] do not merge alone, we should merge as group either in the mornings/afternoons or both everyday
        [] only use yarn on command line, npm might cause merging errors
        [] use netlify to deploy

        This is the template for the Product Vision Document that teams complete after their initial icebreaker. The PVD is crucial to the planning phase and **is mandatory for all groups to complete and submit to their Project Lead before starting their project.**
